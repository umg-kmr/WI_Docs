WinDynB, Warm Inflationary Dynamics and Bayesian analysis 
=========================================================

WinDynB (**W**\arm **in**\flationary **Dyn**\amics and **B**\ayesian analysis ) is a suite of applications that numerically solve the Warm Inflationary background equations, compute inflationary observables like :math:`A_s`, :math:`n_s` and :math:`r` that can further be used to perform bayesian analysis on the warm inflation model of interest.

The suite has two components:

#. C++ code that solves the background and computes the primordial scalar and tensor power-spectrum.
#. Python codes to perform the bayesian analysis (based on Cobaya) and generate plots.

The C++ code handles the computationally intensive background solution efficiently especially when used with Cobaya to perform bayesian analysis. The python codes are used for ease of analysis and plotting with seamless interface to the C++ code. The WinDynB code suite has been designed to be customizeable and extensible to accomodate different Warm Inflationary models. The potential :math:`V(\phi)` and form of the dissipation coefficient :math:`\Upsilon(\phi,T)` can be changed without touching the solver code.
